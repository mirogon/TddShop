Figure out a good way for ui and app to work together

Options:

1. App calls Ui functions to show certain menus and handles state
2. Ui runs independently from the app and triggers events that the app responds to
3. Ui has internal state that the app uses (polls) to call the right ui function at the right time

Example 1
1. MainMenu is shown
2. User selects Shop Menu
3. App changes state to shop menu after ui.MainMenu returns the user selection
4. App calls ui.ShopMenu()

Example 2

1. MainMenu is shown
2. User selects shop menu
3. Ui triggers SelectedShopMenuEvent
4. App calls ui.ShopMenu()

Example 3

1. MainMenu is shown
2. User selects shop menu
3. Ui stores user selection of shop menu
4. App polls the current state and calls ui.ShopMenu()
