NEW!

App doesnt have ui, Ui has App, because the Ui needs to get and set things in the app, 
so it should be higher level than the app

Or, probably even better: App is the highest level that has a Ui and ShopApp, Ui also gets the ShopApp injected

Example: A new item gets added to the shop

	1. Create Shop, Customer, App (App has shop and customer)
	2. Create Ui and inject App
	3. Ui shows MainMenu
	4. User selects Shop Menu
	5. Ui shows Shop Menu and gets info from App->Shop
